# CNVision

## Introduction
Our goal is to enhance copy number (CNV) calling and filtering using advanced machine learning techniques. We focus on leveraging bidirectional encoder models, such as **DNABERT-2**, to improve the classification of CNV breakpoints from a reference genome. For instance, Sniffles2 calls for a Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) benchmark dataset can be cross-referenced with CNV breakpoints on the GRCh38 reference genome. These breakpoints can then be used to derive sequences for training models to identify insertions, deletions, inversions, and false positives.
